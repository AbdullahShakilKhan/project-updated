        What Is HTML? Hypertext Markup Language Basics Explained
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows
        the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a
        web page) such as tags and attributes. </p>
    <p>HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Web development.</strong> Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page
            elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong> Internet navigation.</strong> Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and
            websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong> Web documentation.</strong> HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to
            Microsoft Word.</li>
    </ul>
