    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>

    <p>Web development typically refers to the coding and programming side of website production. When you learn web
        development, you might start out writing a simple page of HTML text and build up to creating more complex,
        feature-rich applications designed to be accessed from various Internet-connected devices. Examples of
        feature-rich web development include e-commerce websites, content management systems (CMS), and social
        networks. Common programming languages and software web developers may use include Hypertext Markup Language
        (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, PHP, Drupal, and MySQL.</p>

    <h2>Types of web development:</h2>

    <p>There are different types of web development: front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.Footnote1 Note that
        web developers specialize in building websites, as opposed to mobile applications, video games, or software.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Front-end development</strong> refers to the client- or user-facing side of websites. Front-end
            developers design and develop the visual
            aspects of a website, including the layout, navigation, graphics, and other aesthetics. Their main job is to
            build interfaces that help users reach their goals, so front-end developers are often involved in user
            experience (UX).</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Back-end development</strong> focuses on everything the user doesnâ€™t see. Back-end developers work
            with servers, operating systems, application programming interfaces (APIs), and databases. They manage the
            code for security, content, and site architecture. They collaborate with front-end developers.</li> <br>

        <li><strong>Full-stack development</strong>encompasses both the front-end and back-end sides of a website or
            software program.Footnote2 Full-stack developers can create a website from start to finish. In addition to
            understanding HTML and CSS, these developers know how to program a browser, server, and database. They are
            skilled at working with the different technologies that handle different functionalities on a website, often
            requiring years of training and experience. </li>
