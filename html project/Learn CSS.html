    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets language and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language
        such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site. The relation between HTML
        and CSS is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the
        aesthetics of an entire website.CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996 for a rather simple
        reason. HTML element was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You were only supposed to
        write the markup for the web page. CSS uses a simple English based syntax with a set of rules that govern it.
        Like we’ve mentioned before, HTML was never intended to use style elements, only the markup of the page. It was
        created to merely describe the content.

    But how do you style the paragraph? The CSS syntax structure is pretty simple. It has a selector and a declaration
    block. You select an element and then declare what you want to do with it. Pretty straightforward, right?

    However, there are rules you have to remember. The structure rules are pretty simple, so don’t worry.

    The selector points to the HTML elements you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations
    separated by semicolons.

    Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. A CSS declaration always ends with
    a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>

    <h2 class="head2">Understanding CSS</h2>
    <h3>1) CSS Syntax</h3>
    <p>The foundation of CSS lies in its syntax, which is composed of two main parts: selectors and declarations.
        Selectors indicate the HTML element to be styled, and declarations specify the style to apply. A declaration is
        further divided into a property (what to style) and a value (how to style it).</p>
 <center>
        <table style="text-align: center;" border="1px" >
            <tr>
                <th>Component</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Selector</td>
                <td>Targets the HTML element to be styled</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Property</td>
                <td>Indicates the aspect of the element to be changed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Value</td>
                <td>Specifies the style applied to the property</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </center>
    <h3>2) CSS Selectors </h3>
    <p>Selectors play a pivotal role in CSS, determining which elements a set of style rules should apply to. CSS offers
        a range of selectors, allowing designers to target elements based on their tag name, class, id, attribute, and
        more.</p>
    <center>
        <table  style="text-align: center;" border="1px" >
            <tr>
                <th>Selector Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Element</td>
                <td>Selects all elements of a given type</td>
                <td>p {…}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Class</td>
                <td>Selects all elements with a specific class attribute</td>
                <td>.class {…}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ID</td>
                <td>Selects a single element with a specific id attribute</td>
                <td> #id {…}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Attribute</td>
                <td> Selects elements based on their attributes</td>
                <td>a[href] {…}</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    <h2 class="heading">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Let’s sum up what we have learned here about CSS and how it helps with the aesthetic of web pages:

        CSS was created to work in conjunction with other markup languages like HTML. It is used to stylize a page.
        There are three styles of implementing CSS, and you can use the External style to accord multiple pages at once.
        You won’t go far without seeing some kind of CSS implementation nowadays since it’s as much of a requirement as
        the markup language itself.</p>
